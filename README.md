# LC News

A fully functional, responsive frontend to the LC News API.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running locally:

- Clone this repo and then run the command `npm install` from the root directory. This will install all the necessary dependencies.
- Run the command `npm start` to start a server. This should automatically open LC News in your browser, but you can also navigate to the URL given in the console.
- Make changes and save - the app should reload to reflect them. And you're off!
